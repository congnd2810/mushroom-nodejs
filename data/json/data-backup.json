            "First described  from Bavaria in 1762 by Jacob Christian Schaeffer, who gave it the name Agaricus arvensis (although like many mushrooms it later spent some time in the genus Psalliota before reverting to its original Agaricus home), the Horse Mushroom is a cosmopolitan mushroom. ",

            "The specific epithet arvensis means 'of the field' or 'of meadows' - a reference to the habitat in which the Horse Mushroom is most commonly found. Less obviously, the common name may not be the more obvious to horses and its  apparent appetite for horse manure (and hence the common occurrence of this mushroom near stables or fields in which horses graze) but, some people have suggested, an allusion to the large size that these mushrooms can attain.

        "Cap": "The cap of Agaricus arvensis matures at  8 to 20cm (exceptionally to more than 30cm) diameter. White but yellowing gradually with age, smooth or finely scaly, the cap is initially spherical and expands until it is flat or nearly so. The thick flesh is white and firm. The cap turns yellowish where bruised, and old caps often take on a yellow-brown tinge.",

        "Stem": "Up to 10cm tall, the parallel stem usually a small bulb at its base and a robust, double ring with a cog-wheel form on the underside.The solid stem is smooth above the ring but sometimes finely scaly below. Its diameter ranges from 2 to 3cm.When cut at the stem base, Agaricus arvensis does not rapidly turn bright yellow - a useful visual distinction between this edible mushroom and the poisonous Yellow Stainer, Agaricus xanthodermus, whose stem base turns chrome yellow as soon as its cut flesh is exposed to air. ",
        "Odour/taste": "Taste not distinctive. Strong odour of aniseed. (The rather similar Yellow Stainer has an unpleasant phenolic or inky odour - a useful way of distinguishing between the edible Horse Mushroom, which also bruises slightly yellow, and that toxic toadstool Agaricus xanthodermus.) ",
        "Habitat & Ecological role": "Agaricus arvensis appears in manured meadows and beside bridle paths and other places where there is plenty of decaying organic matter, upon which it feeds saprophytically. The Horse Mushroom is one of the largest and most distinctive fungi in its genus, often forms fairy rings many metres in diameter in permanent pastures. ",
        "Season": "August to November, typically a week or two later than the Field Mushroom, Agaricus campestris, with which the Horse Mushroom is sometimes confused.",
        "Similar species": "The poisonous Yellow Stainer, Agaricus xanthodermus, quickly turns bright chrome yellow when cut or bruised, and it smells of iodine or ink rather than of aniseed.Agaricus urinascens var. urinascens (syn. Agaricus macrosporus) is very similar in appearance but does not turn bright chrome yellow when cut or bruised.; it grows in open grassland and in woodland clearings. The specific epithet of its older synonym refers to the large (for an Agaricus species) size of the spores this mushroom - typically 11 x 6µm - which also distinguishes it from the Yellow Stainer. ",

            "The most important thing is to make absolutely sure that what you have found really is a Horse Mushroom and not a toxic toadstool such as a Yellow Stainer (Agaricus xanthodermus) or, heaven forbid, a Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa). The stem-base colour change resolves the former, and checking that the gills are pink or brown rather than white averts the latter potentially-fatal error.

What a pity that these superb mushrooms don't occur in more places and in greater abundance! Use The Prince in any menu calling for button mushrooms and you are certain to notice a big difference in flavour.

(In the past this mushroom was occasionally referred to as the 'Common Fieldcap', and although many other Agrocybe species are more common than this species its common name in the British Mycological Society's list of English Names for Fungi is now Common Fieldcap. The term  'fieldcap' is derived from Agro-, of fields, and -cybe, head or cap, and is therefore a direct translation of the generic name Agrocybe. The specific epithet pediades means 'of the plains, or 'of the soil'. "

            "Agrocybe pediades  is easily confused with any number of seriously poisonous brownish mushrooms - for example Hebeloma mesophaeum - and so is best considered inedible and therefore  avoided when gathering mushrooms to eat. "

        "Culinary Notes": [
            "Boletus edulis is one of the finest edible mushrooms. Although it can be used in any recipe calling for cultivated (button) mushrooms, there are some dishes in which it truly excels. It is great in rissotto dishes and omelettes, and it certainly has enough flavour to make tasty sauces to be served with meat dishes. Do give our Penny Bun Starter a try; we think you will love it!",
            "When gathering these mushrooms for the table, those that are fully\n    developed but still young are best of all. Caps can be very large (up to\n    30cm across), and so a family feast requires very few of these\n    mushrooms - indeed, one large Cep is quite enough for a risotto for four people.",
            "One of the reasons that Boletus edulis is considered to be such a safe mushroom to collect for the table is that none of its close lookalikes is poisonous. Provided you avoid boletes with red or pink pores you will at least be assured of a passable meal, and if you ensure that Boletus edulis dominates in the ingredients then your mushroom meal will be acclaimed as at least very good if not truly outstanding. For example boletoid fungi such as Leccinum scabrum, the Brown Birch Bolete, can be used to bulk up a cep recipe with both safety and confidence that it will taste pretty good.",
            "Boletus edulis tastes great when fresh; it is also one of the very finest fungi for drying or freezing. We dry our Ceps, as the flavour is certainly not degraded by the process and many people tell us that they find  dried Ceps even more tasty than fresh ones. To dry these mushrooms, cut them into thin slices and either place them on a warm radiator or in a warm oven (with its door open to let the moist air escape).",
            "In the book Fascinated by Fungi (see the sidebar on this page for brief details and a link to full information, reviews etc) there is a good selection of magnificent mushroom menus all based on our 'Magnificent Seven', and Boletus edulis is, of course, one of the seven. After truffles, Ceps (although going by various common names depending on the country, culture and sometimes even the locality) are surely the most highly prized of edible fungi in Europe and the USA, where the name King Bolete is given to Boletus edulis.",
            "In France these chunky edible fungi go by the nickname Bouchon, meaning cork, but more commonly French people refer to them as either cepes or, more formally, cèpes - the accent on the first e is omitted on most websites, however. When in Sweden, I have to remember to refer to this mushroom as Karljohan svamp. In Scandinavia this mushroom is named after   Carl XIV of Sweden and  John III of Norway (1763 - 1818), who despite being born a Frenchman (Jean Bernadotte) was elected, in 1818, to become king of  a united Sweden and Norway when the Swedish royal family had no succession. Why the link to one of the world's finest edible fungi? Simple: he liked them a lot - so much, in fact, that he even tried to cultivate these prized edible fungi in the park grounds of the royal palace, but it seems without success. (Ectomycorrhizal fungi such as Boletus edulis are in general very much more difficult to cultivate than saprophytic fungi.)  "

            "A  note of caution for newcomers to fungal foraging: there are ball-shaped fungi known as earthballs, and some of them can look quite similar to Grey Puffballs; however, they have single skins, their spore-bearing inner material starts off very pale grey and gradually becomes brown or black as the spores mature. Earthballs are inedible and some of them can cause serious poisoning. The most common of these, sometimes found  along with Grey Puffballs on woodland edges, is Scleroderma citrinum, the Common Earthball. The differences in features between puffballs and earthballs are quite obvious once you know what to look for, but it is important to learn how to distinguish these two groups if you plan on gathering edible puffballs for the pot. Amanita phalloides, starts off as a rounded button mushroom, sometimes pure white or with just the faintest hint of olive. I mention this simply to emphasise how important it is not merely to learn how to identify a range of the finest edible mushrooms but, equally importantly, to become  familiar with the identifying characteristics of the poisonous fungi with which they could be confused. For more help with this important safety matter see Fascinated by Fungi; however, some introductory information on edible fungi with toxic imposters online here... ",
            "For a very easy to recognise edible puffball that cannot be mistaken for any other mushroom, see Calvatia gigantea, the Giant Puffball. Unfortunately it's not every day that you stumble across Giant Puffballs, as they are not only uncommon but also very localised in their distribution. If you find a good spot for these mighty meaty meal sources, make a note of it because Giant Puffballs usually reappear in the same places for many years."

Calocybe gambosa is found throughout Europe and in North America. In Germany thius popular edible mushroom rarely appears before the beginning of May, and there it is known as Maipilz (May mushroom). In warmer Meditrerrannean countries Calocybe gambosa can be found in March, and hence its Italian name is Marzolino in reference to the month of its first emergence. ",

St George's Mushroom was later - Classified by German mycologist Paul Kummer as Tricholoma gambosum before Dutch mycologist Marinus Anton Donk (1908 - 1972) reclassified St George's Mushroom as Calocybe gambosa.",

        "Cap": " 5 to 15cm diameter; initially almost spherical, becoming convex and sometimes almost flat, the cap of a St George's Mushroom is often misshapen but generally retains a slightly incurved margin.The cap surface is smooth and white with a light brown tinge that sometimes becomes tan with age.Firm and white, the cap flesh is prone to maggot infestation as the fruitbody ages, and so only fresh young specimens are worth collecting.",
        "Odour/taste": "Mealy odour and floury taste (when uncooked). Cooking removes most of the mealy odour and taste and transforms this into a more delicious mushroom. ",
        "Habitat & Ecological role": "In cropped pastures, often but not always near to deciduous tree,s and on mown roadside verges near to hedges; occasionally in mixed woodland. Calocybe gambosa is considered by some authorities to be a mycorrhizal species, although its habit of sometimes growing in rings is more generally associated with saprophytic fungi. St George's Mushrooms are very common in chalk- and lime-rich areas, but they also appear in moderately acidic grasslands and woodlands. I have found these mushrooms most often under Hazel, Beech, Oak and Silver Birch, but occasionally they occur near conifer hedges.",
        "Season": "April to June in Britain and Ireland; a month or so earlier in southern Europe but as late as June and July in Scandinavia.",
        "Similar species": "St George's Mushroom could be confused with the deadly poisonous Inocybe erubescens, the Deadly Fibrecap, which can appear at woodland edges towards the end of spring; its pale pink gills (rather than white like those of Calocybe gambosa) are adnexed and they turn red when bruised.The mealy smell of Calocybe gambosa helps in its identification, but other white fungi occur later in the year that also have a mealy odour - for example Clitopilus prunulus, The Miller, which has decurrent gills.",
        "Culinary Notes": [

St George's Mushroom can be used in any recipe calling for  cultivated mushrooms. It is good in risotto dishes and omelettes, and it certainly has enough flavour to make tasty soups or sauces to be served with meat dishes. Like other fleshy fungi, St George's Mushrooms are prone to infestation by fly larvae (maggots), and so it is advisable to pick only young specimens for eating and to cut through each mushroom vertically to check for occupants.",

The specific epithet disseminatus is  the past participle of the Latin verb disseminare,  formed from the prefix dis-, meaning 'in all directions' (as in display, disintegrate etc) and seminare, meaning 'to plant' or' to propagate' (as in semen, from which is derived the English word seed). Appropriate for these prolific fungal hordes! ",

This impressive group of Coprinopsis variegata inkcaps was found and photographed in the USA.",
            "Magpies - the birds, that is - are considered by some people to be bad omens; certainly their habit of stealing birds eggs and young birds from the nest does little to endear them to lovers of songbirds. An old nursery rhyme about magpies goes: One for sorrow; Two for joy; Three for a girl; Four for a boy, etc. There are several other versions, with variations on lines three onwards, but they all retain the One for sorrow; Two for joy opening lines. Magpies pair for life, and so seeing just one of these birds could mean that its mate has died - one for sorrow! Seeing two (or more) Magpie Inkcaps on a fungus foray  is a real joy but, in most parts of Britain and Ireland at least, all to uncommon. "

The most important thing is to make absolutely sure that the fruitbodies you use are young and fresh, because as they age these fungi deliquesce and become an inedible sticky mess. Shaggy Inkcaps are an ideal 'breakfast mushroom', gathered when young and fresh and then cooked and eaten right away. It is  important to consume these mushrooms within an hour or two of gathering them, as they deteriorate very quickly even if kept in a refrigerator."

(The generic name Agaricus was given to most gilled fungi in those days, but  species other than the so-called 'true mushrooms' have since been moved to new genera.) It was the great Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries who, in 1838,  transferred The Gypsy  from Agaricus to Cortinarius. Other Cortinarius mushrooms have web-like partial veils that leave at most just a few fine threads clinging to the stem, creating a rusty 'ring zone' when they catch  spores that fall from the gills. Pier Andrea Saccardo (1834-1917) recognised this distinction as significant and transferred The Gypsy to the genus Pholiota, and then in 1879  Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten named it as Rozites caperata, that genus  being established in honour of French mycologist Ernst Roze (1833-1900), and it was by this name that The Gypsy Mushroom was known until very recently. Many field guides currently in print and some major online mycological resources  still refer to this species as Rozites caperata.",

In the genus Cortinarius most species produce partial veils in the form of a fine web of radial fibres connecting the stem to the rim of the cap; however, Cortinarius caperatus is an exception and has a membranous partial veil.",

Cap diameter ranges from 7 to 14cm at maturity.",
        "Gills": "The crowded gills are adnexed to the stem. Initially a pale clay colour, the gills darken gradually as the spores mature and eventually become mid brown or cinnamon. Because the spores may not all ripen together, sometimes the gills develop dark patches reminiscent of some members of the genus Pholiota. ",
        "Stem": "The stipe or stem of Cortinarius caperatus, which is typically 6-12 cm long and 1-2 cm in diameter over most of its length, is slightly swollen at the base. The stem surface is white or very pale buff, as is the stem ring which is initially attached to the rim cap so concealing the young gills. The ring, which is persistent, is positioned just above the mid point of the stem.Fine white longitudinal fibres give the upper part of the stem a matt surface, while much larger fibres near the base create an even more shaggy appearance.

            "The second reason for shunning this and all other members of the genus Cortinarius is that quite a lot of them are seriously poisonous and a few have proven track records as deadly killers (Cortinarius rubellus and Cortinarius orellanus in particular contunue to take lives every year). If it has a cortina (cobweb-like veil) over the gills when young, my advice is not to try eating it.

Zeus survived and overthrew Cronos. The horn of Amalthea, the Cornucopia, inherited the goddess's divine power of providing unending supplies of nourishing food. Craterellus cornucopioides, commonly called the Horn of Plenty, does on occasion provide a bountiful source of food, but on its own it certainly does not constitute a balanced diet and its availability is limited to just a few weeks of the year.

(In those days most  gilled mushrooms were included initially in the genus Agaricus; the vast majority of them have  since been redistributed to many other genera.)",
            "It was not until 1914 that the famous American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill (1869 - 1957), writing in the journal Mycologia, transferred this waxcap to the genus Hygrocybe, establishing the scientific name as Hygrocybe pratensis. In 1985 this species was transferred to the genus Cuphophyllus by French mycologist Marcel Bon, and the name Cuphophyllus pratensis has since become its generally accepted scientific name.",

The nominate form Cuphophyllus pratensis var. pratensis, pictured above and at the top of this page, and described in detail below, has a peach-coloured cap and stem, while Cuphophyllus pratensis var. pallida (also pictured second from top of this page) is pure white. ",
            "Being a large, conspicuous, attractive and edible mushroom, Cuphophyllus pratensis has caught the eye of many great mycologists down the ages. As a result it has acquired several synonyms including Agaricus pratensis (Pers. Gymnopus pratensis (Pers.) Gray, Hygrophorus pratensis (Pers.) Fr., Camarophyllus pratensis (Pers.) P. Kumm., and Hygrocybe pratensis (Pers.) Murrill."

(Its former genus Hygrocybe is so named because fungi in this group are always very moist. Hygrocybe means 'watery head'.)",
            "As a specific epithet pratensis is much easier to fathom out provided you have had a basic grounding in Latin. For those who have not, you will nevertheless be unsurprised to know that it it translates to 'of meadows'. That's where these chunky waxcaps are most often found."

Nevertheless, the Meadow Waxcap is quite well known as an edible mushroom, and in areas where there are enough of these fruitbodies to make collecting them worthwhile there are a few fungiphages who rate them very highly indeed.",
            "Being fleshy and containing plenty of moisture (the latter a characteristic of waxcaps), Meadow Waxcaps can be fried in their own juices. Simply drop them into a hot pan with a bit of salt and pepper; there is no need to add fat or oil. When young and fresh the texture is firm, and so these  wild mushrooms are good served with either meat or fish dishes. ",
            "One other  plus point for this grassland mushroom (in its var pratensis form shown immediately above, of course, not the very rare var. pallida) is that it is difficult to confuse it with any of the poisonous gilled fungi that you are likely to find well away from trees. "

Initially brown and dense, the fruitbodies soon turn black, dry out and become less dense. There is no stipe; the fruitbody is attached to the host wood by a broad, flat area underneath the cushion-shaped fruitbody. The spore-bearing surface is a series of tiny chambers called perithecia, which are embedded within the outside of the fruitbody, and ejected spores leave a slightly darker area of wood around the fungus. Each season a new fertile outer layer develops with new perithecia, inside which the next season's ascospores are produced. Large stroma are therefore much older than small ones. ",

As with other ascomycete fungi there are infertile paraphyses separating the asci.Once the spores inside an ascus have reached maturity, the ascus expands lengthways,guided by the surrounding paraphyses, until its tip extends outside the neck of the perithecium; then water pressure built up inside the ascus bursts open the tip of the ascus and the ascospores are forcibly ejected. The ascus shrivels leaving the opening clear for the next set of eight spores to be expelled. ",

The new genus Fomes was erected by Fries in 1849, and the Flemish mycologist Jean Jacques Kickx (1842 - 1887) transferred Hoof Fungus to that genus in 1867, thus establishing its currently-accepted scientific name as Fomes fomentarius.",

The implication, therefore, is that fungi in the genus Phellinus are the most cork-like (the toughest?) of them all.  The  genus Fuscoporia was established in 2007 by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill (1869 - 1957); the genus name   comes from the Latin adjective fusca meaning dark brown, and is a reference to the dusky (dark brown) pored surface of this polypore.

The basionym (a term used to indicate which name was the original, validly published name of a taxon) was for many years considered to be persistens, but Clements' publication on this species predates others and so the accepted scientific name was changed recently to Hygrocybe acutoconica. You will still see the specific epithet persistens in many recently-published field guides, and indeed the common name Persistent Waxcap has been included in the British Mycological Society's list of Common Names of Fungi.

The much rarer Hygrocybe acutoconica var. konradii. is similar in shape and growing habitat; its cap is sometimes  pure yellow with whitish-yellow gills, but it can also have a red or orange tinge similar to the nominate form. The main distinguishing characteristics (and according to Danish waxcap expert David Boertmann the only reliable way of distinguishing it from Hygrocybe acutoconica var. acutoconica)  are its spores, which are subglobose (9-12 x 7.5-10μm) rather than elongated ellipsoidal like those of var. acutoconica.

(The picture on the right shows Blackening Waxcaps along the bank of the River Teme near Knighton, on the border of Wales and England, where they occur in their hundreds in  good waxcap years.) There would be rather less concern if people collected these grassland fungi rather than  some of the rarer Hygrocybe species; however, although various field guides say that it is edible there is at least one report (from China) of mushroom poisoning attributed to this species. The fact that these insubstantial waxcaps are slimy and quickly turn black when handled is probably enough to deter all but the most fanatical (or famished) fungiphage from making a meal of Blackening Waxcaps."

In Ireland this waxcap is also widespread and fairly abundant. Hygrocybe quieta is also widely distributed throughout northern and central mainland Europe. This waxcap sometimes occurs in woodland settings, as pictured left. ",
        "Taxonomic history": [
            "When French mycologist Robert Kühner (1903 - 1996) described this fairly common grassland mushroom in 1947 he gave it the name Hygrophorus quietus. Four years later the German-born mycologist Rolf Singer (1906 - 1994) transferred the Oily Waxcap to the genus Hygrocybe, since when its accepted scientific name has been Hygrocybe quieta. "
        ],
        "Etymology": [
            "The genus Hygrocybe is so named because fungi in this group are always very moist. Hygrocybe means 'watery head'.",
            "The Latin epithet quieta is probably a reference to the inconspicuous (quiet, unobtrusive) colours of this visually nondescript waxcap. (Some people  refer to this species as the Tranquil Waxcap.) The same specific epithet is applied to one of the rather dull, brown milkcaps, and by coincidence when their gills are cut or crushed  the Oakbug Milkcap Lactarius quietus and the Oily Waxcaps Hygrocybe quieta even smell somewhat similar - they both give off an oily-fruity odour (or, as some authorities suggest, of squashed shield bugs. (Experts on the smell of squashed bugs are welcome to contact us on this matter.) We could of course look for a more interesting explanation: the specific epithet quieta is variously translated as quiet in the sense of 'settled', in other words not moving. Other than the Rolling Puffball Bovista plumbea I can't think of a fungus for which unmoving would be an inappropriate adjective; however, 'Aqua profunda est quieta' translates to 'Still waters run deep' - troubled waters can be calmed (made quiet) by pouring oil on them. There's limited potential here, I fear, as relying on the Oily Waxcap for the necessary unction would definitely restrict us to calming only very small seas. "
        ],
        "Cap": "Dryer than most waxcaps, the cap is yellow or yellow-orange and expands to typically 4 to 6cm in diameter. The caps of the Oily Waxcap are always convex rather than conical; in dry weather they tend to flatten and often become concave (with upturned edges). ",
        "Odour/taste": "This waxcap has a slight soapy or oily odour said (by those who go around sniffing such things) to be reminiscent of bed bugs or shield bugs! If you squash a piece of gill material between your fingers the smell is more readily detectable.",
        "Habitat & Ecological role": "Close-cropped or mown acid grassland where artificial fertilisers are not spread.Waxcaps have long been considered to be saprobic on the dead roots of grasses and other grassland plants, but it is now considered likely that there is some kind of mutual relationship between waxcaps and mosses. ",
        "Season": "August to December in Britain and Ireland.",
        "Similar species": "Gliophorus laetus is smaller, usually darker, and has decurrent gills.Hygrocybe intermedia is very similar but usually more orange and has a fibrous, non-greasy cap that does not smell soapy when squashed. ",
        "Culinary Notes": [
            "Although not known as a seriously toxic toadstool, the Oily Waxcap is not generally considered edible because the caps are so insubstantial (and they do not smell very appetising). In any case, waxcaps of any sort are far from common and picking them cannot improve the situation. "

(In the early days of fungal taxonomy most gilled mushrooms were placed in one gigantic Agaricus grouping, which has since been broken up into  many other genera, leaving in the Agaricus genus a relatively small group of the 'true mushrooms', as they are sometimes called.) Another famous British mycologist, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, moved this species into its present genus in 1884, at which time the scientific name became Laccaria amethystina.",

        "Gills": "The broad, deep gills of the Amethyst Deceiver are widely spaced and interspersed with shorter gills. Long before the cap fades to buff, the gills begin losing their colour.

In normal autumn weather, before the caps fade the tan gills begin losing their colour and become clay-lilac and then buff. This is because they get covered in spores. (Surprisingly, when you consider how dark the young gills are - the spores of this mushroom are white.)",
        "Stem": "Laccaria bicolor stems are 5 to 10mm in diameter and 5 to 14cm tall. The tough, fibrous stems are more 'hairy' towards the base, where the lower part of the stems of fresh young specimens (left) are covered in a lilac-coloured mycelial down. Unfortunately, this lilac colouring soon fades, so that identification of older, more mature fruitbodies is more difficult. (The basidia of some Laccaria species are two-spored while others are four-spored, but to see these features you need to be skilled in using a high-powered microscope.) ",
        "Odour/taste": "Not distinctive.",

Leotia viscosa is of similar size and shape to Leotia lubrica but this rare species differs in having a dark green cap. ",

The second point is all to do with quality: use only fresh young fruitbodies which, when cut in half along the vertical axis, are white all through. Discard any that have begun turning yellow, olive or brown, as this indicates that the spores are maturing and the flavour will be seriously marred if you include them in your dish.

            "Lycoperdon utriforme  is not one of the 'Magnificent Seven' edible fungi featured in chapter 10 of Fascinated by Fungi, but if gathered when very young this is a fairly good edible mushroom and can make a  good meal if prepared and cooked properly. Here are a couple of tips. The first important step is to remove the tough outer skin and infertile stem - a fiddly job perhaps best done with a sharp knife. The second point is all to do with quality: use only fresh young fruitbodies which, when cut in half along the vertical axis, are white all through. Discard any that have begun turning yellow, olive or brown, as this indicates that the spores are maturing and the flavour will be seriously marred if you include them in your dish. Probably the simplest meal that you can make with puffballs is a mushroom omelet; they can also be fried or used to make soups."

            "Here is a   note of caution for newcomers to fungal foraging: there are ball-shaped fungi known as earthballs, and some of them can look quite similar to Mosaic Puffballs; however, the spore-bearing inner material of these thick-skinned gasteromycete fungi starts off very pale grey and gradually becomes brown or black as the spores mature. ",
            "Earthballs are inedible and some of them can cause serious poisoning. The most common of these, found on woodland tracks (and sometimes along with common puffballs), is Scleroderma citrinum, the Common Earthball.",
            "The differences in features between puffballs and earthballs are quite obvious once you know what to look for, but it is important to learn how to distinguish these two groups if you plan on gathering edible puffballs for the pot.",
            "There are also some poisonous gilled mushrooms which, when young, could be mistaken for Lycoperdon utriforme, the Mosaic Puffball. Amanita muscaria, the Fly Agaric, first appears as a white-warted round button - the red cap skin does not show through until the cap has expanded somewhat - and at that stage it could quite easily be mistaken for a Mosaic Puffball. Even more seriously, the infamous Deathcap, Amanita phalloides, starts off as a rounded button mushroom, sometimes pure white or with just the faintest hint of olive. I mention this simply to emphasise how important it is not merely to learn how to identify a range of the finest edible mushrooms but, equally importantly, to become  familiar with the identifying characteristics of the poisonous fungi with which they could be confused. For more help with this important safety matter see Fascinated by Fungi; however, some introductory information on edible fungi with toxic imposters online here... ",
            "For a very easy to recognise edible puffball that cannot be mistaken for any other mushroom, see Calvatia gigantea, the Giant Puffball. Unfortunately it's not every day that you stumble across Giant Puffballs, as they are not only uncommon but also very localised in their distribution. If you find a good spot for these mighty meaty meal sources, make a note of it because Giant Puffballs, like Mosaic Puffballs, usually reappear in the same places for many years."

It fully deserves it place in the Magnificent Seven (seven fantastic free food fungi and how to cook them - see Fascinated by Fungi chapter 10.) If you are new to gathering wild mushrooms for the pot here are a couple of tips to help you when gathering Parasols. First, avoid small specimens. It is possible to find examples of Lepiota procera with caps smaller than 10cm across when fully expanded; however, they make only modest meals and, more importantly, you could by mistake end up collecting some of the small poisonous Lepiota species (nowadays referred to as 'dapperlings' but still recorded as various kinds of 'parasols' in some reference books). One simple way of minimising such risks is to shun any specimens with caps smaller than 10cm across when fully expanded; but do also check carefully the other identifying characters of this delicious mushroom. ",
            "The second tip is more to do with quality. All fungi deteriorate in flavour and texture as the fruitbodies become old. (They may even become fly blown and maggoty.) So I recommend gathering Parasols at either the 'large drumstick' or 'partly expanded umbrella' stages of development. By the time you get them home they will have expanded further, and the ideal time to pop them into the frying pan is when they have almost flattened out. The cooking process will ensure that your Parasol caps quickly expand to lie flat in the pan. (Of course, you will need to remove the stems, but don't discard them as they can be chopped up to make a perfectly acceptable mushroom soup.) "

The Stinkhorn and the Morel have several features in common: their caps are pitted and roughly comparable in size, and quite often they are found in the same kinds of woodland habitats. (Phallus impudicus generally is most common later in the year than Morchella esculenta, but there can be an overlap period when the two species occur together.) ",

Typically 8 to 15cm tall; stipe diameter is 1 to 1.5cm. The cap is honeycombed beneath the gleba (a shiny, sticky, smelly coating that contains the spores).Once insects have consumed the dark olive gleba, the tip of the fungus turns orange and then the whole fruitbody decays rapidly: there is usually nothing left within three or four days.

            "Although they are not known to be seriously poisonous, these are definitely not delectable fungi. Several people have reported their dogs being very sick after eating mature Dog Stinkhorns, and so it's most likely that any person eating mature specimens would suffer a similar fate. In China the dried eggs of Dog Stinkhorn are readily available in shops and, it seems, they are quite popular as edible fungi - but maybe the big attraction is their assumed medicinal value.

            "This oddball mushroom has confounded mycologists down the ages as they struggled to fit it in to existing genera. There has been much debate as to whether this mushroom  should be considered a member of the Agaricaceae (grouped with field mushrooms and their kin, as we have it here); some suggest it has more in common with Pholiota species, which belong to the family Strophariaceae. Now placed in a genus all on its own (the technical term for this is 'monotypic'), the Golden Bootleg's basionym dates from 1779, when   German botanist Heinrich Gottfried von Mattuschka (1734 - 1779) described this species and gave it the binomial name Agaricus aureus. (At the time most gilled mushrooms were placed in a gigantic Agaricus genus, who contents have since been largely redistributed across many newer genera.) It was not until 1928 that French mycologists Paul Konrad (1877 - 1948) and André Maublanc (1880 - 1958) renamed the Golden Bootleg as Phaeolepiota aurea, which remains its accepted scientific name.",
            "Synonymy is often an indication of the degree of perplexity caused by a species, and in this respect the Golden Bootleg is quite exceptiona, with at least 20 synonyms among which are Agaricus aureus Matt., Agaricus vahlii Schumach., Agaricus spectabilis Weinm., Pholiota aurea (Matt.) P. Kumm., Pholiota spectabilis (Weinm.) P. Kumm., Togaria aurea (Matt.) W.G. Sm., Pholiota   vahlii (Schumach.) J. E. Lange, Fulvidula spectabilis (Weinm.) Romagn., Gymnopilus spectabilis (Weinm.)

It's true that cooking reduces the concentration of the toxic acid, but it is still potentially quite dangerous. Shun this risky snack!"

When there is a stem it is brown, and the attachment is either central or eccentric; stems are short (up to 6cm in length) and stout (typically 3 to 5cm in diameter), tapering towards the base. Initially the fruitbodies are soft and spongy, eventually becoming dry and hard. Often compound (several fused together), they tend to grow around and so enclose twigs, pine needles, grass and other objects as the caps expand. ",

        "Habitat & Ecological role": "Parasitic on the roots of coniferous trees, particularly pines and spruces but also occasionally larches.

I take all this to mean that these are polypore fungi and that they are attached only weakly  to their host trees (rather than the pore layer being easily removable from the rest of the bracket, which is in my experience definitely not the case)."

The specific epithet is much easier: dryad means  oak, and the suffix -eus means belonging to or pertaining to; so, fungi with dryadeus as part of their scientific name are found with or on oaks.

Significantly, however, Lenz would have been very much aware that several people who had eaten this bolete had soon afterwards been taken ill with symptoms of diarrhoea, stomach pains and sickness. Cases of poisoning due to eating Rubroboletus satanas are rare, and that is probably because mature specimens smell so putrid that they are unlikely to tempt anyone who has a nose. I have found only one reference to a death being attributed to poisoning caused by eating this bolete, and it is unclear whether the victim had been otherwise healthy or already weakened by some other illness. Nevertheless, and despite reports of Suillellus satanas being gathered for eating in some European countries, our clear advice has to be: 'Don't even consider eating them, either raw or cooked'.",

The only common edible bolete with which it could reasonably be confused is Neoboletus luridiformis - and for that reason alone it seems sensible to leave all red-pored boletes off the menu. Neoboletus luridiformis is considered to be a good edible mushroom if properly cooked, but to enjoy it you have to get used to fungi that turn blue when cut and then almost black when cooked... and, unless you enjoy playing Russian Roulette and the like, to sleep comfortably afterwards you need to be 100% confident about the identification."

Me too. The current genus name Rubroboletus is a reference to the red colouring of the stem and pores of this bolete. The specific epithet satanas means 'of the devil'. It is reported that Dr Lenz  gave this bolete its diabolical name because he felt ill when he was describing it. Most people who have seen the Devil's Bolete say that it is one of the most beautiful of all wild mushrooms. "

Thorough cooking is said to remove the majority if not all of the toxins, but most authorities still treat this species as a toxic toadstool that should not be collected for human consumption.

Only about 5% of the world's (known!) 750 or so brittlegills can be identified on sight with any degree of confidence. For many species colour is no guide at all, because individual specimens can be red, orange, yellow, white, green, blue, purple (you get my drift) or a combination of several of these colours. So, record every character (feature) that you can. look at  specimens at different stages in development, note which kind of tree(s) they are near to, and then check them against a well-respected Russula key for the country/region you found them in. And then resign yourself to  the fact that they won't always key out (and that doesn't necessarily mean that you have found a new species!). I'll be you will have more failures than successes...at least until you become a Russula expert, of which there are maybe a dozen or so in the world - and I am lucky enough to have met two of them.

Provided the caps are mature enough to display the distinctive quilting that is associated with this species, it is difficult to mistake this for any other woodland mushroom.

The curly nature of these hairs is a crucial identifying characteristic, but to see it clearly requires strong magnification. The edges of young cups are often slightly incurved.

Often the hardest part of the preparation process is extracting all of the debris, some of which the fruitbodies may have grown up through. Wood Cauliflower fungi are very good when either baked or fried, and of course you can always add them to soups and stews. Cut the fungus into small florets, making sure that no debris in included within the tortuous folds of the fungus. Wood Cauliflower fungus can be used as the basis of a delicious Cauliflower (Fungus!) Cheese, and once you have made a nice cheesy sauce (Parmesan is an ideal basis for this) you simply pour it over a greased oven-proof dish of florets of Wood Cauliflower and then bake in the oven until the top is golden brown, just as you would if using vegetable cauliflower. The Wood Cauliflower is also one of the very best fungi for drying, because it re-constitutes so well."

Yellowing Curtain Crust is indeed much less hairy than Stereum hirsutum, which is known as Hairy Curtain Crust."

The peelable cap cuticles, which are very viscid in wet weather, are various shades of yellowish brown.\n    \n    \n      \n      Tubes and Pores\n        Beneath the cap, the fertile surface comprises short tubes, adnate or very slightly decurrent to the stem, terminating in small angular pores that are initially creamy yellow, becoming bright yellow and then taking on a brownish tinge as they age. In well-shaded sites,  droplets of a clear liquid appear on the pore surface of young specimens.

            "Originally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who gave it the binomial name Boletus versicolor, it was as recently as 1939 that this species was renamed Trametes versicolor by the Czech mycologist Albert Pilát (1903 - 1974). ",
            "Synonyms of Trametes versicolor are many and include Boletus versicolor L., Poria versicolor (L.) Scop., Agaricus versicolor (L.) Lam., Polyporus fuscatus Fr., Polyporus versicolor (L.) Fr., Polystictus azureus Fr., Polyporus nigricans Lasch, Coriolus versicolor (L.) Quél.,      and Polystictus versicolor (L.) Cooke. "
        ],
        "Etymology": [
            "Trametes, the genus name, comes from the prefix tram- meaning thin and -etes meaning 'one whi is' - hence the implication is that fruitbodies of fungi in this genus are thin in section. ",
            "The specific epithet versicolor  means 'of several colours', a descriptive name that is fully justified not only by the variability of colouring from specimen to specimen but also the presence of several colour bands on the upper surface of a single fruitbody. ",
            "The beautiful Turkeytail seen above was found at Long Hill, Mere, Wiltshire, UK, and photographed by Keving Smith, with whose kind permission it is shown here. "
        ],
        "Size ": "Caps can be up to 10cm in diameter, and they frequently overlap in layers to form much larger compound fruiting masses. These brackets are 1 to 3mm thick.",
        "Description ": "While the upper surface comprises concentric zones of red, yellow, green, blue, brown, black and white, the underside, which is covered in tiny shallow pores spaced at 3 to 6 pores per mm, is white or cream. The pores do not stain significantly when bruised.",
        "Odour/taste": "No distinctive smell or taste.",
        "Habitat & Ecological role": "This thin, leathery fungus attacks mainly dead wood, fallen or standing. It is most commonly found on hardwoods such as beech and oak, mainly as a saprobic (wood-rotting) fungus but sometimes as a weak parasite on living trees.",
        "Season": "These annual bracket fungi can be found all the year round, but they are at their best in autumn and winter, which is when they release their spores.",
        "Similar species": "Trametes suaveolens is a much paler bracket and does not usually grow in overlapping tiers.Several corticioid fungi (crusts) can produce zonate fruitbodies; among them are Stereum species, which differ from Trametes in having smooth spore-bearing undersides rather than having pores. See Stereum subtomentosum for example. ",
        "Culinary Notes ": [
            "Although not generally reported as  poisonous, these bracket fungi are far too tough to be considered edible. Turkeytail is used in Chinese medicine, however, and there are also scientific reports of its use in anti-cancer drug development. "
